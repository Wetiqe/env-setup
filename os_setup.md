# Ventoy
Ventoy is a powerful, open-source and easy-to-use tool that can be used to create a bootable USB drive with multiple ISO images. It is an essential tool for anyone who needs to boot multiple operating systems from a single USB drive.

Ventoy is compatible with a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and more. This is the best portable tool I have ever used to install Linux. Recommend to all beginners.
